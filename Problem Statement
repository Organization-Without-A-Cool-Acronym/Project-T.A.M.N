#Problem Statement
FGCU students have difficulty finding available parking spots on campus during school hours. Project T.A.M.N aims to develop 
an app that will track the number of spaces available in each parking garage on campus. This will allow any student to check
their phone and know where they will be able to find parking during the day.
